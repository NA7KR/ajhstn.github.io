Recent I begun organising my onedrive documents by year/project, then using selective sync, only keeping my current projects on my computer, leaving finished projects and irregularly used documents in onedrive alone.  When i am finished with a project or folder tree, i can simply unselect it in OneDrive Sync tool settings.

Not that we necessarily need the disk space these days but this helps keep my local machines neat and tidy.

It also helps when moving amongst different machines I only have a small amount of onedrive documents and folders to sync.

I hope this helps you with an idea how you can customise this to your own likings.
